# **CI**
This project implements a simple continuous integration (CI) server. It is built to be used with the webhook functionality provided by Github when there is a push event. Once the server recieves a request from the webhook it will run the tests of the pushing branch and return a report of the status of the branch. The implementation also provides a web server that hosts the results of the testing/linting.

## Features
### Static analysis on python code (pylint)
Static analysis of the code is done using [pylint](https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0) with default settings. The result is sent to the email-recipient (currently: group.19.dd2480@gmail.com) and is also available and browsable on the persistent host. Every successful run of the analysis will produce a score between 0 and 10. This score, if 5 or below, will cause this part of the staging to result in 'error'.

This feature has been unit-tested through test_pylint_if_no_tests_in_dir in app_test.py

### Test automation on python code (pytest)
The CI server assumes that the target code base is using the pytest framework for testing. Testing is done by executing the command ``python3 -m pytest`` in the target project folder. The result is then captured through listening on the process' stdout. The result is sent to the email-recipient (currently: group.19.dd2480@gmail.com) and is also available and browsable on the persistent host. If testing results in any errors, then this part of the staging will result in 'error'. If there aren't any errors but still failures, then this part of the staging will result in 'failure'.

Only if pytest returns no errors or failures and pylint returns a score above 5 will the staging result be succesful.

This feature has been unit-tested through test_pytest_if_no_tests_in_dir in app_test.py

### Notification via mail and status update on github on push events
Notification is implemented via email by sending a mail from our local email account to the designated email
addresses via an SMTP server. Notification is also implemented via status updates by sending a request to the
Github API to update the commit status.

This feature has been unit-tested through TestCheckCommit in check_test.py

The email notification implementation is tested by sending a test email to a
local designated receiver and comparing the subject and body of the email sent, and the email received. The status update
test is also implemented similarly, with a test status update being sent to the repository and by comparing the message
that was sent with the one that was received.

This feature has been unit-tested through test_notification in app_test.py

### Persistent storage and hosting of test/linting results on http://localhost:81
Persistent storage is done using the simple http.server found within Python3. The files are found locally at ``/tmp/CILogs`` which will be created if not already present during launch.

## How to use:
To install all dependencies and run the server do: 
```
make all
```

A personal access token is also required to update commit statuses. It can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and should be placed in /tmp/auth.

## Requirements
* Python ~= 3.8.5
* Pip ~= 20.0.2
* Make ~= 4.2.1
