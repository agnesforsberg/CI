# **CI**
This project implements a simple continuous integration (CI) server. It is built to be used with the webhook functionality provided by Github when there is a push event. Once the server recieves a request from the webhook it will run the tests of the pushing branch and return a report of the status of the branch.


# Features
* Static analysis on python code (pylint)
* Test automation on python code (pytest)
* Notification via mail and status update on github on push events 

## How to use:
To install all dependencies and run the server do: 
```
make all
```

A personal access token is also required to update commit statuses. It can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and should be placed in /tmp/auth.

## Requirements
* Python ~= 3.8.5
* Pip ~= 20.0.2
* Make ~= 4.2.1
